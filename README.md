# UFOs

## Overview
We're tasked to help data journalist Dana, build a webpage using a JavaScript file filled with citing information. We are tasked to use Javascript to manipulate and display data for others of UFO sightings. Using tables, images, and easy to use filters, we are tasked to build an HTML page that can display the citing information for the public to see. 

## Results

By using the filters, we can input dates, cities, states, countres, as well as shapes in relation to specific sightings that appeared in the data file that we have. 


## Summary

##### Drawbacks & Recommendations
There is a possibility that the search is limited to the data that is used. Although this is a publically accessible website, the data can be quite limited in regards to it not being able to pull more data types such as time of sighting or actually search through an engine that would give you vast amounts of information to look from. Another drawback is that the information is not updated in real time, therefore at some point, the data becomes obsolete. 

Recommendations would be to input functions that would scan the vast internet for information related to sightings. This would ultimately increase the value of the website in which there would be more data to pull from as well as updated data in real time.
